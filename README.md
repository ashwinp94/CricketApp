# Kirriket

Kirriket is my first simple CRUD application using React. Kirriket originated as a way for people to track their performances and log their stats for the sport of cricket. The application allows a user to:
1. Record and keep track of your performances in matches
2. Create events for watch parties or upcoming matches
3. Keep track of and add followers
4. See your followers events and their statistics 

## Getting Started
The Kirriket application utilizes React, React-Router-Dom, and Bootstrap.
1. clone rep
1. run `npm install` to pull in dependencies
1. run the JSON server at `json-server -p 5002 -w database.json` ( `npm install -g json-server` if necessary )
5. `npm start` in root directory to start react server
6. create a new account and login
